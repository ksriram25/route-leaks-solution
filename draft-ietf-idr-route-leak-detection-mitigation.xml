        Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route leaks are provided in <xref target="RFC7908"/>.
        This document describes a inter-AS (multi-hop) solution for detection and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying route-leak detection information in new well-known large community - route leak detection community (RLD).
        RLD community gives ISPs an easy way to detect route leaks, and, if needed, propagate information about such incidents.
        This solution complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak avoidance solution that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7908"/> provides a definition of the route leak problem, and enumerates several types of route leaks.
        For this document, the definition that is applied is that a route leak occurs when a route received from a transit provider or a lateral peer is forwarded (against commonly used policy) to another transit provider or a lateral peer.
        The commonly used policy is that a route received from a transit provider or a lateral peer MAY be forwarded only to customers.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes a solution for detection and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying route-leak information in a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community.
        These document specifies well-known community for these purpose - route leak detection (RLP).
        Its configuration policies MUST be defined according to peering relations between ISPs.
        If BGP Roles described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref> are configured, community configuration SHOULD be implemented in code of routing software.
      </t>
      <t>
        Described technique can be incrementally deployed.
        If a group of big ISPs or/and IXes deploy proposed route marking, then they would be helping each other by blocking route leaks that can happen between them.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="relations" title="Peering Relationships">
      <t>
        As described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref> there are several common peering relations between eBGP sessions:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Provider - sender is a transit provider to neighbor;</t>
          <t>Customer - sender is customer of neighbor;</t>
          <t>RS - sender is route server at internet exchange point (IX)</t>
          <t>RS-client - sender is client of RS at internet exchange point (IX)</t>
          <t>Peer - sender and neighbor are peers;</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If the route is announced to a customer, peer or RS-client it MUST go 'only down' and should not be received by other ISPs from links with customers, peers or received by IX route server.
        So, we need a transit signal that will tell a remote ISP that receiving prefix violates 'only down' rule and thus providing a way to stop the propagation of leaked prefixes.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="community" title="Community vs Attribute">
      <t>
        In this section will be discussed the advantages and disadvantages of communities and BGP path attributes for the purpose of route leak detection.
      </t>

      <t>
        The transit path attribute seem to be a native way to implement route leak detection signal.
        The way BGP process unknown transit attributes guarantees that such a signal will pass through outdated BGP implementations without any change.
        The main disadvantage lays on a fact that such deployment will require a software update which will postpone wide adoption for years.
      </t>

      <t>
        In opposite, communities doesn't require software update.
        The main disadvantage of communities is that its usage is highly overloaded.
        They already have multiple use cases: different types of route marking, route policy control, blackholing and etc.
        That's why a significant number of networks with purpose or accidentally are removing communities on receipt, even well-known ones.
      </t>

      <t>
        With the knowledge that route leaks can disrupt Internet connectivity in the region or even globally the authors believe that it's better to move forward with route leak detection using communities.
        It's not a theoretical threat - it's constantly happening events.
      </t>

      <t>
        To nevilate listed disadvantages of community usage, we suggest using large communities, which have much higher capacity, so it should be less overloaded.
        We suggest reserving 4200000000 class for the purpose of transit well-known communities that MUST not be stripped on both ingress and egress filters.
        Also, policy violation is itself result of absent or improper community configuration.
        So, the chance that route-leak-detection community will pass through ISP that already has configuration mistakes is highly increased.
      </t>

      <t>
        While it's not part of this document the described bellow signals can be easily translated into BGP path attributes.
        The authors suggest to evaluate the effectiveness of leak detection using community, and if needed implement signal via path attribute too.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="detection" title="Route-Leak Detection Community">
      <t>
        This section specifies exact semantics of route-leak-detection community and its usage.
        The RLD community MUST follow next semantics:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>4200000000 - suggested class for well-known transit large communities;</t>
          <t>1 - RLD subclass;</t>
          <t>value - ASN who set the community</t>
        </list>
        This community MUST be set if route is announced to Customer, RS-client or Peer with ASN value equal to the senders Administrator ID.
      </t>
      <t>
        The are three rules that enable detection and mitigation of route leaks:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>If route with RLD community set is received from Customer or RS-client - it's a route leak and MUST be rejected.</t>
          <t>If route with RLD community set is received from Peer and RLD value isn't equal to neighbor ASN - it's a route leak and MUST be rejected.</t>
          <t>A route with RLD community set MUST not be sent to Peer, Provider or RS.</t>
        </list>
        These rules provide an easy way to detect policy violation at the per-prefix granularity.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        In specific circumstances at the state of partial adoption, route leak detection mechanism can result in DoS for the victim prefix.
        Such scenario may happen only for prefixes that has a single path from originator to Tier1 and doesn't covered with less specific prefixes with multiple paths to Tier1.
        If in such unreliable topology route leak gets injected in this single path at may be rejected, thus limiting prefix visibility.
        While such anomaly is unlikely to happen, such an issue should be easy to debug, since it directly affects the sequence of originator's providers.
      </t>

      <t>
        With the use of BGP community, there is often a concern that the community propagates beyond its intended perimeter and causes harm <xref target="streibelt"></xref>.
        However, that concern does not apply to the RLD community because it is a transitive community that must propagate as far as the update goes.
      </t>

      <t>
        The proposed route leak information carried in the RLD community can benefit from cryptographic protection to prevent abuse by malicious actors in the AS path.
        In the future, if there is BGPsec deployment, the RLD community can be encoded in the Flags field in the Secure_Path Segment in BGPsec updates <xref target="RFC8205"></xref>.
        So, the cryptographic security mechanisms in BGPsec can also secure the route leak detection information.
        The reader is directed to the security considerations provided in <xref target="RFC8205"></xref>.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        The draft suggests to reserve Global Administrator ID 4200000000 for transit well-known large community registry.
        IANA is requested to register RLD community in the well-known large community <xref target="RFC8092"></xref> registry.
