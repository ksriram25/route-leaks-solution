      <t>
Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route leaks are provided in RFC 7908. This document describes a solution for detection and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying route-leak protection (RLP) information in a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community.  The RLP information is carried in a new well-known transitive BGP community, called the RLP community. The RLP community helps with detection and mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream from the leaking AS (in the path of the BGP update). This is an inter-AS (multi-hop) solution mechanism. This solution complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak avoidance solution that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.

<!--
The solution is meant to be initially implemented as an enhancement of BGP without requiring BGPsec [RFC8205]. However, when BGPsec is deployed in the future, the solution can be incorporated in BGPsec, enabling cryptographic protection for the RLP field. That would be one way of implementing the proposed solution in a secure way. The document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for an intermediate phase when OV is deployed but BGP protocol on the wire is unchanged.

    <section title="Introduction">
      
<t>

RFC 7908 <xref target="RFC7908"></xref> provides a definition of the route leak problem, and enumerates several types of route leaks. For this document, the definition that is applied is that a route leak occurs when a route received from a transit provider or a lateral peer is forwarded (against commonly used policy) to another transit provider or a lateral peer. The commonly used policy is that a route received from a transit provider or a lateral peer may be forwarded "down only" to customers.

</t>
<t>
This document describes a solution for detection and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying route-leak protection (RLP) information in a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community.  The RLP information is carried in a new well-known transitive BGP community, called the RLP community. The RLP community helps with detection and mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream from the leaking AS (in the path of the BGP update). This is an inter-AS (multi-hop) solution mechanism. This solution complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak avoidance solution that is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref>.
</t>
<t> 
Previously, an optional transitive BGP RLP Attribute was proposed to carry the RLP information <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation"></xref>. However, this document proposes a well-known transitive BGP community to carry the RLP information, with the intention of promoting faster adoption. 
</t>
<t> 
The inter-AS RLP mechanism described here can be incrementally deployed. Early adopters would see significant benefits. If a group of big ISPs deploy RLP, then they would be helping each other by blocking route leaks originated within one's customer cone from propagating into a peer's AS or their customer cone. 
</t>
	    </section> 

	    <section anchor="methods" title="Mechanisms for Detection and Mitigation of Route Leaks">

<t>
There are two considerations for route leaks: (1) Prevention of route leaks from a local AS <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref>, and (2) Detection and mitigation of route leaks in ASes that are downstream from the leaking AS (in the path of BGP update). This document specifies the latter.
</t>

<section anchor="relation" title="Ascertaining Peering Relationship">
<t>
There are four possible peering relationships (i.e., roles) an AS can have with a neighbor AS: (1) Provider: transit-provider for all prefixes exchanged, (2) Customer: customer for all prefixes exchanged, (3) Lateral Peer: lateral peer (i.e., non-transit) for all prefixes exchanged, and (4) Complex: different relationships for different sets of prefixes <xref target="Luckie"></xref>. For the complex case, the peering role types provider, customer, or lateral peer apply for different non-overlapping sets of prefixes.
</t>
<t>
Operators rely on some form of out-of-band (OOB) (i.e., external to BGP) communication to exchange information about their peering relationship, AS number, interface IP address, etc. If the relationship is complex, the OOB communication also includes the sets of prefixes for which they have different roles. <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref> introduces a method of re-confirming the BGP Role during BGP OPEN messaging (except when the role is complex). It defines a new BGP Role capability, which helps in re-confirming the relationship when it is provider, customer, or lateral peer. BGP Role does not replace the OOB communication since it relies on the OOB communication to set the role type in the BGP OPEN message. However, BGP Role provides a means to double check, and if there is a contradiction detected via the BGP Role messages, then a Role Mismatch Notification is sent <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
When the BGP relationship information has been correctly exchanged including the sets of prefixes with different roles (if complex), then this information SHOULD be used to automatically set the role per-prefix with each peer. For example, if the local AS's role is Provider with a neighbor AS, then the per-prefix role is set to 'Provider' for all prefixes sent to the neighbor, and set to 'Customer' for all prefixes received from the neighbor.
</t>
<t>
Once the per-prefix roles are set, this information is used in the RLP solution mechanism that is described in this document.
 
</t>

<section anchor="semantics" title="Route-Leak Protection (RLP) Semantics">
<!--
<t>
This section, <xref target="receiver"></xref> and <xref target="mitigate"></xref> describe methods of detection and mitigation of route leaks in an AS downstream from the leaking AS.
</t>
-->

<t>
The key principle is that, in the event of a route leak, a receiving router in a transit-provider AS (e.g., referring to <xref target="fig1"></xref>, ISP2 (AS2) router) should be able to detect from the RLP community in the update message that its customer AS (e.g., AS3 in <xref target="fig1"></xref>) should not have forwarded the update (towards the transit-provider AS). Likewise when the update is received from a lateral peer. This means that at least one of the ASes in the AS path of the update put RLP information in RLP community to indicate that it sent the update to its customer or lateral peer, but forbade any subsequent 'Up' (customer to provider) or 'Lateral' (peer to peer) forwarding.

<t>
The RLP information contained in the RLP community consists of one or two AS numbers (ASNs) and has the following semantics:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
Down Only (DO) indication: ASN of the most recent RLP-aware AS in the path to assert that it sent the update to a customer or lateral peer;
</t>
<t>
Leak detected (L) indication: ASN of the first RLP-aware AS in the path to assert that it forwarded the route from a customer or lateral peer despite detecting a leak (to avoid unreachability). 
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
If the RLP community is present in an update, it will always contain a single DO. However, L need not be always present. (Note: The bits designated to carry L may be always present along with a DO, except that a default value (all zeros) is carried in L when no AS in the current AS path needed to assert L.) Once an AS asserts L (Leak detected) by inserting its ASN value, it MUST not be changed subsequently as the update propagates. But the ASN value in DO (Down Only) is changeable along the AS path per its definition above.      
</t>
<t>
Design assumption 1: Operators desire to avoid unreachability. So, a design assumption here is that in the absence of an alternative route, an AS may select and forward a route that is detected to be a leak. (Note: This is the reason Leak detected (L) indication is part of the design.)   
</t>
<t>
Design assumption 2: An AS that is RLP-aware (i.e., implements the RLP solution in this document) MUST also implement an intra-AS solution for route leak avoidance in the local AS. The latter solution uses an intra-AS signaling mechanism (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy"></xref>, Section 3.7 of <xref target="RLP-Discussion"></xref>). By doing this, the AS locally prevents the leaking of routes learned from a transit provider or lateral peer to another transit provider or lateral peer. Why this is critical to the overall solution is made clear in slides 7 and 8 of <xref target="sriram2"></xref>.

<section anchor="receiver" title="Route Leak Detection Rules and the Ingress Router (Receiver) Actions">

<t>
A received BGP update is determined to be a route leak if: 
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
if L is present in the update; 
</t>
<t>
else (L is absent), the update is received from a customer and DO is present;
</t>
<t>
else (L is absent), the update is received from a lateral peer and DO is present that is not the lateral peer's ASN. 
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Note: Here by "L is present" we mean that its value is not the default value (all zeros) but is a proper ASN. Effectively "L is absent" if its value is the default value.     
</t>
<t>
In steps 2 and 3 above, the ingress router (receiver) MUST add L = local ANS. Doing this prior to the best path selection process is necessary. Also, if the route is selected as best path, then L is already set correctly before the egress router (sender) acts on it.
</t>

</section>
<section anchor="decision" title="Route Selection Policy">
<t>
Minimum Default Policy: Whenever there is a choice between a customer route and a provider route that are both detected to be leaks (L is present), then lower the LocalPref to X (TBD by operator) for each of them. Then shortest path criterion would typically make the customer route preferred. (Note: This would help mitigate any possibility of persistent oscillation; see slide #7 in <xref target="sriram1"></xref>.)
</t>
<t>
Generalized Minimum Default Policy: Whenever there is a choice between multiple routes (customer/peer/provider) and each is detected to be a leak (L is present), then lower the LocalPref to X TBD by operator) for each of them. Then apply shortest path criterion. (Note: Some network operators may find this inadequate; see scenarios #3 and #6 in slides #14 and #16, respectively, in <xref target="sriram2"></xref>. But they may locally modify their policy while respecting the basic principle.)
</t>
</section>

With the use of BGP community, there is often a concern that the community propagates beyond its intended perimeter and causes harm <xref target="streibelt"></xref>. However, that concern does not apply to the RLP community because it is a transitive community that must propagate as far as the update goes.   
</t>
<t>
The proposed Route-Leak Protection (RLP) information carried in the RLP community can benefit from cryptographic protection to prevent abuse by malicious actors in the AS path. In the future, if there is BGPsec deployment, the RLP information can be encoded in the Flags field in the Secure_Path Segment in BGPsec updates <xref target="RFC8205"></xref>. So, the cryptographic security mechanisms in BGPsec can also secure the RLP information. The reader is directed to the security considerations provided in <xref target="RFC8205"></xref>.
